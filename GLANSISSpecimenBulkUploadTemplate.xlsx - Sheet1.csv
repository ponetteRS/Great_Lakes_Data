SKIP This can be derived from Genus species in processing,,,,decimal degrees,decimal degrees,"controlled field - GNIS, Map derived, reported, USCensus (County centroids), Calculated (HUC centroids)","controlled field - Accurate, Approximate, Centroid","short text description, Waterbody name first",Y/N,,,,,,,can duplicate column to include up to 3 suspected pathways or leave blank will default to unknown -- extensive controlled vocabulary,,,"controlled field - established, stocked, failed, unknown, extirpated, locally established, eradicated, cultivated.  Use unknown as the default for a first report at a particular location (unless stocked/cultivated is more appropriate).  A second year at the same location is usually sufficient for 'established' (reproducing and overwintering) longer-lived species may require additional evidence.
